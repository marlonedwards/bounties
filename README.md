# Bounties
Platform for crowdfunding original video ideas.

People want to watch original content, creators want to make original content - and get paid.

## Platform Structure
### User Sign-up
TikTok and Google sign-on will serve to onboard the most users and verify content submissions.
Otherwise, users can sign up via a traditional username/password.

### Creating Proposals
Users can create a proposal for their original content idea.
Proposals require the following:
- Title
- One-liner describing the idea
- Platform the content should be hosted on (YouTube, TikTok, etc.)
- Extended description with background information

### Submitting Original Content
Any user can submit their videos. The platform uses TikTok and YouTube APIs will verify if the video exists and belongs to the creator. 

## Voting + Payment Mechanisms
### Proposal Ranking
Similar to traditional forums, users can upvote or downvote proposals. The proposals are ranked by vote differential and amount contributed.

### Contributing to a Bounty
Most content creators receive payment via PayPal or Stripe. These options are kept to maximize funding activity on the site. Receiving cryptocurrency is an option for creators that do not have access to or want to avoid traditional payment platforms.

Users that vote and/or contribute to a proposal have a say in the submission(s) that receive the bounty.
